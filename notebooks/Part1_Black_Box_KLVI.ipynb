    "# Part 1: Black Box KLVI \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first of a two part series that walks through the key ideas of my thesis. The goal is to allow users to walk through and recreate my main thesis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thesis Problem: Use alternative divergence measures (aside from the KL divergence) to estimate posterior distributions more accurately for a single factor confirmatory factor analysis model.** \n",
    "\n",
    "My thesis investigates whether we can use a generalised divergence measure to perform black box variational inference to solve the problem of variance underestimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variance underestimation problem is when posteriors estimated using VI (Variational Inference)  **underestimate** the true posterior variance. It occurs whenever we use the typical divergence measure (KL Divergence), in both analytical **and** black-box implementations of VI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on applying black box KL Variational Inference (KLVI) via reparameterisation gradients to the single factor confirmatory factor analysis model (CFA model), using the classic Holzinger Swineford (1939) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook has three outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Outline mathematical basis of the thesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I demonstrate that black box KLVI can be applied to the single CFA model.** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **I replicate the finding of variance underestimation via black box KLVI** \n",
    "    * We replicate the results of KD Dang, who applied KLVI to the single CFA model via analytical methods rather than black box methods. Dang found that analytical KLVI estimates posterior means accurately, but underestimates true posterior variances. We find the same results hold for black box KLVI."

As $\\alpha$ approaches 1, the Renyi alpha divergence converges to the KL Divergence. The Renyi divergence measure from the posterior $p(\\theta)$ to any variational approximation $q(\\theta)$ is given by: \n",

    "$$\n",

    "the optimised variational distribution ${q^{*}(\\pmb{\\theta})}$ will tend to be forced to zero whenever  ${p(\\pmb{\\theta} \\, | \\, \\mathbf{x})} \\approx 0$. Therefore, zero forcing behaviour will tend to understimate the posterior support. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, minimising the Renyi divergence for any valid $\\alpha > 0$ is done in practice by maximising the VR Bound, which is a generalisation of the ELBO and which converges to $\\text{ELBO}(q)$ as $\\alpha \\rightarrow 1$: \n",
    "\n",

    "### Increased mode seeking or zero forcing behaviour as $\\alpha >> 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "On $\\alpha >> 1$, minimising the VR Bound results in an optimised ${q^{*}(\\pmb{\\theta})}$ that should theoretically result in more and more pronounced zero forcing behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass covering behaviour for $\\alpha < 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, on $\\alpha < 1$ the expression $\\left[\\frac{{p(\\mathbf{x}, \\,  \\pmb{\\theta})}}{{q(\\pmb{\\theta})}}\\right]^{1-\\alpha}$ is a decreasing function of $\\frac{q(\\theta)}{p(\\theta)}$, so is reasonable to expect that ${q^{*}(\\pmb{\\theta})}$  optimised under an $\\alpha <1$ routine may exhibit less zero forcing behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalise optimisation routine to $\\alpha < 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, $\\alpha< 0$ does not define a valid divergence but the VR optimisation objective with $\\alpha < 0$ is still well defined. However, there are compelling mathematical arguments for why using an appropriate $\\alpha < 0$ may result in some mass covering rather than zero forcing behaviour."
